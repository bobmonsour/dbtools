These are a set of node scripts that support managing the data that drives the [11tybundle.dev](https://11tybundle.dev) website. The data is stored in a json file. They will evolve over time to add more functionality, e.g., editing and deleting entries.

They are not very well documented at the moment...and they are likely of little use to anyone but the curious.
